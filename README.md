## What is it?

The DiagBolik Watch is a simple and **completely FREE** application that allows you to load the Diag on Apple Watches. ï£¿

##
## System Requirements

DiagBolik is compatible for macOS X Mojave and higher, only mac with Intel CPU is supported, so **no** M1 CPU. *Remember to see the **Tips** button in the app!*

## Watch Support

For the moment the application ***supports only*** the Apple Watch Series 0 (38mm and 42mm) and ***a SPAM*** (or SPAM2) ***cable is required*** to communicate with the Series 0. However, you can use any type of adapter as long as it allows enter DFU mode and detect the SPAM cable. In the future I will add support for other watches as well :grimacing:! (max up to Apple Watch Series 3 due to exploit)

## What the program requires

In order for the exploit to work you need to make sure you have [libusb](https://libusb.info/) installed. You can also use [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/) via the terminal command
```
brew install libusb
```
If you are installing brew.sh for the first time remember that it can take some time to complete the installation. Regarding the exploit it can fail many times and be a real pain :exploding_head:, follow the **Tips** in the app for more information.
